# NFT Pets

---

### Project Goals 


### Outline
1. Generate NFTs based on pixel art generated by OpenAI Dall-E
2. Middleman that will take percentage of all sales
3. Different pages based on Ganache account that is logged in through MetaMask
4. Make a marketplace to buy and sell NFTs between accounts
	- have a list of all the minted nft pets
	- add art registry code to be able to set your price for your minted nft pet
5. Image generation code based on list of animal names
        - add st.selectbox for choosing what type of animal you want
        - hard code "pixel art" prefix to whatever animal chosen
6. ChatGPT integration to talk with your selected nft pet

Optional
7. Add Pokemon-like game features (edited)

## Technologies

This is a Python 3.8 project that uses the following dependencies:

1. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (1.2.0) - Web app interface
2. [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (2.7.0) - Ethereum blockchain
3. [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) (0.8.19) - Language for smart contract
4. [Remix](https://remix-project.org/) - IDE for Web3 developement
5. [ChatGTP](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (3.5) - Chat features
6. [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/) - Image creation
7. [MetaMask](https://MetaMask.io/) (10.28.1) - Blockchain Wallet

## Installation

This project is ran using a [conda dev environment](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). 

Assuming you have Python installed you should be able to install the required dependencies using the following commands: 

```
pip install web3==5.17
pip install streamlit
pip install openai
pip install python-dotenv
```

However, if you have conda set up you can directly copy the environment that we used to create this project with [requirements.txt](./Resources/requirements.txt):

Create a copy of the conda dev environment with `conda create --name myenv --file ./Resources/requirements.txt`

Then install the requirements with `conda install --name myenv --file ./Resources/requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run our app, you will need to create a local blockchain using Ganache and deploy the [pet_token.sol](./Smart_Contracts/pet_token.sol) smart contract on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) using an injected [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) provider.

1. Open Ganache and create a quickstart Ethereum workspace. 

    ![Ganache opening screen showing workspaces and buttons to create new workspaces](./Resources/Images/ganache_workspaces.png)

2. Using the MetaMask browser extension, setup a network how "devNetwork" is setup with the RPC url as HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545 and Chain ID as 1337.

3. Click on the account bubble in the top right of MetaMask to open the dropdown and use the "Import Account" button to create accounts. This will open a form to input a private key of an account, you can use this form to enter in the private keys of however many accounts you want from your newly created Ganache blockchain. You can grab the private key of an account by clicking the key icon at the far right of each account listed in your Ganache workspace.

    ![Public address and private key of a ganache account after pressing key icon](./Resources/Images/ganache_private_key.png)

4. Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and upload the provided [pet_token.sol](./Smart_Contracts/pet_token.sol) smart contract in the "File Explorer" section. You should be able to view the full code as a Solidity smart contract.

5. Compile the pet_token.sol file in Remix under the "Solidity compiler" section using the 0.5.5+commit.47a71e8f compiler.

6. Go to the "Deploy and run transactions" seciont of Remix to deploy the "PetToken - pet_token.sol" contract. You can leave the gas limit as the default but make sure to select the correct contract to deploy. Assuming you have correctly set up your accounts in MetaMask, when you use the "Environment" dropdown in Remix you will see an option that says "Injected Provider - MetaMask". Clicking this option will open up a MetaMask Notification window where you can select all of the accounts you imported. Select which accounts you wish to use and click the next button, there will then be another screen where you can click the connect button to successfully connect your Ganache accounts. 

    ![Selected the injected provider option in remix and selecting the accounts in the metamask notification window](./Resources/Images/deploy_accounts.png)

7. Click the "Deploy" button in the remix UI and another Metamask notification should pop up where you can press the confirm button to deploy the pet_token.sol smart contract with the selected ganache account under the "Account" field in the Remix UI. You will notice in Ganache that the selected account will now have less Ethereum because it paid for the gas to deploy the contract. In remix, you will see "PETTOKEN at ..." under the "Deployed Contracts" section of the "Deploy and run transactions" tab.

    ![PETTOKEN at ... listed under the deployed contracts section of Remix UI](./Resources/Images/deployed_contracts.png)

8. Hover over the deployed PETTOKEN contract in the "Deployed Contracts" section to copy the contract address.

9. Clone the nft-pets repo from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/fintech-quagga-group/nft-pets.git`

10. In your local clone of nft-pets, create a .env file and add two lines like so:

    ```
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URI = 'HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545'
    SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ''
    ```

    You can then put in the copied contract address from step 8 in the quotes for SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

11. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/overview](https://platform.openai.com/overview) and create an OpenAI account to access their API. 

12. Once you are logged in, click on your account icon and use the "View API Keys" button on the dropdown list to access the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You can then use the "Create new secret key" button to get your OpenAI API key.

    ![Header of the https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys page](./Resources/Images/openai_api_keys.png)

    ![Create secret key on open ai api keys page](./Resources/Images/create_secret_key.png)

13. Add the line `OPENAI_API_KEY = ''` to your .env file and fill in the quotes with the API key you generated in the previous step. Your final .env file should now look like: 

    ```
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URI = 'HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545'
    SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ''
    OPENAI_API_KEY = ''
    ```

14. With Ganache open on your newly created workspace, your smart contract deployed on Remix, and your .env file setup with your secret keys, you are ready to run the app. In VSCode or your terminal you can run the app using the command `streamlit run app.py`
